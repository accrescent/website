                <h1>Features</h1>

                <p>The following is a list of notable features Accrescent currently has. It is not
                exhaustive and not all features listed are exclusive to Accrescent, but they are
                some of the more distinguishing features and are intended to give the reader an idea
                of the benefits of Accrescent and how it works.</p>

                <section id="signed-metadata">
                    <h2><a href="#signed-metadata">Signed repository metadata</a></h2>

                    <p>Accrescent's repository contains metadata files used by the client to
                    retrieve apps and display info about them to the user. One of these pieces of
                    metadata is signed by a key hardcoded into Accrescent to protect against
                    tampering of sensitive information in the event the server is compromised. This
                    signed metadata supports key rotation, is downgrade-protected, and a minimum
                    revision hardcoded into Accrescent is regularly updated to protect new
                    installations and sideloaded Accrescent updates from being served old
                    metadata.</p>

                    <p>Below is a list of what the signed metadata protects and the corresponding
                    security implications for the user.</p>

                    <section id="key-pinning">
                        <h3><a href="#key-pinning">App signing key pinning</a></h3>

                        <p>When a developer submits a new app to Accrescent, a hash of their app's
                        public signing key is added to the signed repository metadata. This signing
                        key hash is checked by the client every time it downloads the respective
                        app. If it doesn't match, the installation is rejected.</p>

                        <p>This check is unnecessary for updates since Android already enforces key
                        pinning for app updates. However, the OS takes a trust-on-first-use approach
                        and doesn't provide a mechanism to verify that the initial installation was
                        signed by the proper certificate, so pinning the certificate in signed
                        metadata ensures that even the first installation is legitimate.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="min-version">
                        <h3><a href="#min-version">Minimum version pinning</a></h3>

                        <p>Each app in the signed metadata has a minimum expected version which is
                        updated regularly. Accrescent will refuse to install a version of a given
                        app less than its minimum version.</p>

                        <p>This check mitigates the threat of an attacker serving obsolete versions
                        of apps. If a minimum version was not set, an attacker in control of the
                        server could specify the latest version of a given app as an old version
                        with known security vulnerabilities. Android already enforces downgrade
                        protection for existing apps, so this threat is only applicable to users
                        installing a given app for the first time.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="name-icon-verification">
                        <h3><a href="#name-icon-verification">Name verification</a></h3>

                        <p>Accrescent stores app names in signed metadata. These are used to verify
                        the app names displayed to the user in the client UI.</p>

                        <p>Signing the app name makes it more difficult for an attacker to trick a
                        user into installing a malicious copycat app. If names weren't verified, a
                        malicious actor in control of the server could modify it and trick a user
                        into installing a different app than they intend.</p>
                    </section>
                </section>

                <section id="unattended-updates">
                    <h2><a href="#unattended-updates">Unattended updates</a></h2>

                    <p>Accrescent supports unattended updates with or without privileged integration
                    into the OS. By default, it will prompt for confirmation the first time an app
                    is installed and perform updates in the background without prompting
                    thereafter.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="split-apks">
                    <h2><a href="#split-apks">Split APK support</a></h2>

                    <p>Accrescent serves all apps as split APKs. This means that native code for
                    different architectures, images for different screen densities, and strings for
                    different languages aren't downloaded for a given device, saving bandwidth.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="no-remote-signing">
                    <h2><a href="#no-remote-signing">No remote APK signing</a></h2>

                    <p>Accrescent doesn't sign apps itself. Developers sign (split) APKs with their
                    own keys and upload them to Accrescent themselves.</p>

                    <p>This measure allows developers to maintain exclusive control over their app
                    signing keys. Developers' signing keys cannot be compromised if Accrescent's
                    servers are and Accrescent cannot deliver modified updates to developers'
                    apps.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="no-accounts">
                    <h2><a href="#no-accounts">No accounts</a></h2>

                    <p>Accrescent doesn't have user accounts. Users can simply install the store and
                    use it. This design makes Accrescent more accessible and more private since user
                    accounts can often be used to track user behavior.</p>

                    <p>Note that developers still need to create accounts on the
                    <a href="https://console.accrescent.app">developer console</a> to publish
                    apps.</p>
