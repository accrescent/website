                    <h2><a href="#status">When will Accrescent become stable?</a></h2>

                    <p>There isn't an ETA for Accrescent's stable release, but there is a
                    <a href="https://github.com/orgs/accrescent/projects/4/views/2">public roadmap</a>
                    that represents its current stage of development. If you would like to help
                    Accrescent become stable sooner, check out the high priority open issues on the
                    roadmap.</p>

                    <h2><a href="#app-submission">How do apps get into Accrescent?</a></h2>

                    <p>Developers submit their built and signed apps to Accrescent directly through
                    the <a href="https://console.accrescent.app">Accrescent Developer Console</a>.
                    Accrescent doesn't build, sign, or update developers' apps itself. For more
                    detailed information, see the
                    <a href="/docs/guide/getting-started/index.html">developer documentation</a>.</p>

                    </h2>

                    <p>Accrescent has strict quality control measures to ensure the security and privacy
                    of all submitted apps. For specific details on what these measures are, see the
                    <a href="/docs/guide/appendix/requirements.html">requirements section</a> of the
                    developer documentation.

                <section id="other-repos">
                    <h2><a href="#other-repos">Does Accrescent support third-party repositories?</a></h2>

                    <p>Accrescent intentionally does not support third-party repositories and has no
                    plans to support them. There are a few technical reasons for this. For one,
                    supporting third-party repositories breaks the Android security model. Android
                    assumes one app (e.g. Accrescent) is a single app source. When this assumption is
                    broken, bad things can happen. For example, say Accrescent supported third-party
                    repos and is integrated into an Android-based OS as a first-party app source. If a
                    given user or work profile is restricted from installing apps from third-party
                    sources by an MDM or OS settings, they could trivially bypass said restrictions by
                    adding a third-party repository.</p>

                    <p>Another reason Accrescent doesn't support third-party repos is lack of available
                    security features. The chain of trust between Accrescent and the signed repository
                    metadata would be weakened since Accrescent can't reasonably maintain a list of
                    hardcoded keys for all third-party repos. TLS certificate pinning is also
                    impractical to implement for third-party servers.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="open-source">
                    <h2><a href="#open-source">Do apps in Accrescent need to be open-source?</a></h2>

                    <p>Apps do not need to be open-source to be submitted to Accrescent. Although
                    open-source software provides additional transparency and can make it easier for
                    users to check overall code quality, it is not inherently more secure or private
                    than closed-source software. Likewise, proprietary software is not inherently less
                    secure or private than open-source software. Since Accrescent is focused on security
                    and privacy it wouldn't make sense for it to restrict developers to a specific
                    source model.</p>

                    <p>However, Accrescent recognizes the benefits of open-source and so is
                    open-source itself. In the future, apps in the store will additionally be able to be
                    tagged as open-source and filtered for in the client.</p>

                <section id="verifying">
                    <h2><a href="#verifying">How can I verify my download of Accrescent is legitimate?</a></h2>

                    <p>If using <a href="https://grapheneos.org">GrapheneOS</a>, the recommended
                    method to verify Accrescent is to install it from the GrapheneOS App Store. This
                    approach chains the verification of Accrescent to the OS, which can in turn be
                    chained to a hardware root of trust through verified boot and GrapheneOS'
                    Auditor app.</p>

                    <p>For other Accrescent users, Accrescent's signing certificate hash can be
                    verified by using
                    <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/apksigner#usage-verify">apksigner</a>
                    with the <code>--print-certs</code> option. Certificate hashes are published here,
                    <a href="https://github.com/accrescent/accrescent#signing-certificate-hash">on GitHub</a>,
                    and
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/accrescentapp/status/1555439120519835650">on Twitter</a>.

                    <p>You should check the certificate hash from a different source than you got
                    the app from. For example, if you download Accrescent from GitHub, you should
                    verify the certificate hash from Twitter or this website to distrust the
                    server.</p>

                    <p>Signing certificate hash:
                    <code>067a40c4193aad51ac87f9ddfdebb15e24a1850babfa4821c28c5c25c3fdc071</code>.</p>

                    <h2><a href="#contributing">How can I contribute to Accrescent?</a></h2>

                    <p>There are many ways to contribute to Accrescent even if you can't code. Below is
                    a list of all of the ways you can help the project.</p>

                    <h3>Programming</h3>
                    <p>The most obvious way to help Accrescent is to contribute code. All repositories
                    can be found under the
                    <a href="https://github.com/accrescent">GitHub organization</a>. If you're not
                    sure what to work on, the
                    <a href="https://github.com/orgs/accrescent/projects/4/views/2">public roadmap</a>
                    contains all project issues sorted into different categories and labeled by
                    priority. Feel free to ask questions about development in our
                    <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#accrescent:matrix.org">Matrix room</a> as
                    well.</p>

                    <h3>Bug reports / feature suggestions</h3>
                    <p>Another way to help is by testing and reporting bugs in the app and other
                    Accrescent subprojects. Bug reports are accepted in the respective repository issue
                    trackers and the <a href="https://github.com/accrescent/meta">meta issue tracker</a>
                    if you're not sure where to report the bug. You can also report issues in the
                    <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#accrescent:matrix.org">Matrix room</a> although
                    they're more likely to get lost in the chat there. Feature suggestions can be made
                    in the same places.</p>

                    <h3>Translation</h3>
                    <p>Translations are accepted for the Accrescent app on
                    <a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/accrescent/">Hosted Weblate</a> or
                    through pull requests. Currently the website is English only, but there are plans to
                    accept translations for it in the future.</p>

                    <h3>Documentation</h3>
                    <p>Documentation improvements are welcome. All documentation is hosted on this
                    website, and you can submit changes to
                    <a href="https://github.com/accrescent/accrescent.app">our GitHub repo</a>

                    <h3>Donations</h3>
                    <p>Accrescent is funded purely by donations. Funding goes directly toward
                    covering costs for servers, development hardware, development work, and
                    organizational fees. If you'd like to contribute to Accrescent financially,
